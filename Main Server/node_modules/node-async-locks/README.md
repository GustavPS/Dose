# node-async-locks

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BorisKozo/node-async-locks.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/BorisKozo/node-async-locks)

A set of asynchronous lock patterns for Node.js

## Documentation

This readme file contains basic usage examples and
details on the full API, including methods,
attributes and helper functions.
To use the library simply do

````
npm install node-async-locks --save
````

in your favorite command line tool


## Module Components:

* **AsyncLock** A constructor function for creating asyc locks.
* **ResetEvent** A constructor function for creating reset events.
* **Wrapper** A wrapper module that provides access to the previous modules and allows simple management for your locks.


## Why do you need async lock on a single threaded environment?
While your JavaScript code runs in a single threaded fashion (i.e. there is only a single thread running each function in the same context),
 the entire code runs in a multi threaded environment.
Consider a function that gets some data from a database*, updates it and saves it back to the database.
Your code may look something like this:

```js
function update(){
   db.retrieve('some_query', function callback(data){
       ... do some manipulation on data ...
       db.update('some_query', function ack(){
          ... some code after query complete
       });
   })
}
```

This code contains three separate functions - _update_, _callback_, and _ack_. While you know the order in which these
three functions are called in a single flow, you cannot be sure in which order they are called in multiple, concurrent, flows.
For example if _update_ is called twice the order may be - update, update, callback, callback, ack, ack. In this case the second call
to callback function is manipulating an outdated version of the data because the updated version is still inside the first call to callback and was not
yet updated in the database. An async lock is a pattern which can help you ensure the correct calls order between the functions:

```js
var AsyncLock = require('node-async-locks').AsyncLock;

function update(token){
   db.retrieve('some_query', function callback(data){
       ... do some manipulation on data ...
       db.update('some_query', function ack(){
          token.leave();
       });
   })
}

var asyncLock = new AsyncLock();

function safeUpdate(){
    asyncLock.enter(update);
}
```
The _safeUpdate_ function uses an async lock to asynchronously block any subsequent calls to update until
_ack_ was called by the update function. Once the the token calls the _leave_ function on the async lock automatically
triggers the next call to _update_ if such exists (you can always cancel the calls using timeouts or manually). This code
ensures that the order of calls is always: update, callback, ack, update, callback, ack.

*I am aware that there are better ways to ensure this type of thing when updating data to a database but I wanted to give
 an example of a simple real life scenario. You can replace the database with any typical async flow such as reading and
 writing to files or doing some calculations.

## AsyncLock

A constructor function which allows the creation of the async lock.

```js

var AsyncLock = require('node-async-locks').AsyncLock;

```

### Basic Usage

Create an async lock and use the enter function to create a critical section.

```js
    var lock = new AsyncLock();
    lock.enter(function (token) {
        //this code will be executed by only one caller at a time
        //...
        lock.leave(token);
    });
});
```

### Helper Functions

AsyncLock uses several helper functions (on the **prototype**) which can be overridden on a specific instance to provide custom functionality.

#### AsyncLock#createToken(callback) -> token

A function that creates all the tokens that are used by this lock instance (a token per _enter_ call).
The token has the following fields:

* **id** - A unique id for each token, must be comparable using === operator.
* **isCanceled** - A boolean representing the cancellation state of the token.
* **callback** - The callback to be called when the token is ready to execute.
* **elapsed** - [optional] A function which returns the elapsed time between the creation of the token and now.
* **start** - [optional] The start time of when this token was created.
* **lock** - [optional] A reference to the lock that created this token.
* **leave** - [optional] A convenience function to leave the lock using this token.

#### AsyncLock#executeCallback(token)

A function which is used to execute the callback on the token.
The default implementation will execute the callback asynchronously
after successful acquiring of the lock.

#### AsyncLock#reduceQueue(queue, options)

A function which is used to reduce the lock queue size when a call to _enter_ is made and the queue has a limited size.
If the options are changed pragmatically after an instance of the lock was created,
it is up to the user to call this function to adjust the queue size.
Override this function to create different queuing logic.

### AsyncLock API

The main API of the AsyncLock object created by the AsyncLock.
_AsyncLockInstance_ represents an instance created by calling ````new AsyncLock()````

#### AsyncLock#constructor(options) -> AsyncLockInstance

Creates a new AsyncLockInstance using the given options.
If no options are provided the default options are used.
The default options defined as ````AsyncLock.defaultOptions```` as:
```js
{
        maxQueueSize: Infinity,
        overflowStrategy: 'this'
}
```
Override any default option to make all future lock instance to be created with the new defaults.
Locks within the ````Wrapper```` are created with these options as well.

##### Supported Options

* **maxQueueSize** (number) [default Infinity] - The maximum number of queued pending callbacks. Note that the executing callback is not considered pending.
* **overflowStrategy** (string) [default 'this'] - The strategy that will be used when a callback causes the pending queue to exceed the _maxQueueSize_.
The value symbolises the item that is going to be removed from the queue to accommodate for the new callback.
Possible values are: 'this' - The current (the callback that caused the queue to exceed _maxQueueSize_) callback is going to be removed from the queue.
'first' - The first (oldest) callback is going to be removed and the current callback will be added at the end. 'last' - The last callback is going to be removed
and the current callback will take its place.

Assuming the queue contains the callbacks [A,B,C] the callback D is the current callback and _maxQueueSize_ is 3, the resulting queue is:
* 'this' - [A,B,C]
* 'first' - [B,C,D]
* 'last' - [A,B,D]

```js
 var lock = new AsyncLock({maxQueueSize:3});
 var token = lock.enter(function (innerToken) {
          // innerToken === token
          // write the safe code here
          lock.leave(innerToken);
        });
      });
```

#### AsyncLockInstance#enter(callback,[timeout]) -> token

Tries to acquire the lock and when successful executes the _callback_. If the lock
cannot be acquired waits (asynchronously) until the lock is freed.
The callback function signature is _callback(token)_, it will receive the token returned by the enter function.
If _timeout_ is provided will wait only the given amount of milliseconds and then cancel the callback setting the _isCanceled_ property to true on the token.
If _timeout_ is not provided will wait indefinitely.

```js
 var lock = new AsyncLock();
 var token = lock.enter(function (innerToken) {
          // innerToken === token
          // write the safe code here
          lock.leave(innerToken);
        });
      });
```

#### AsyncLockInstance#leave(token,abortPending)

Leaves the lock and allows the execution of the next called to _enter_.
The _token_ must be the token that acquired the lock otherwise an exception is thrown.
The callback of the next caller to _enter_ will be triggered based on the _executeCallback_ function (default is asynchronous).
If _abortPending_ is true (boolean) then all the pending callbacks are canceled and will not be called. For each canceled callback
token.isCanceled is set to true.

```js
 var lock = new AsyncLock();
 lock.enter(function (innerToken) {
        setTimeout(function(){
            console.log('First');
            lock.leave(innerToken);
        },2000);
    });
 });

 lock.enter(function (innerToken) {
     console.log('Second');
     lock.leave(innerToken);
 });

//Prints: First Second
```

#### AsyncLockInstance#isLocked() -> boolean

Returns true if the lock is currently acquired and false otherwise.

```js
 var lock = new AsyncLock();
 lock.isLocked(); //false
 lock.enter(function (innerToken) {
          // innerToken === token
          // write the safe code here
          lock.isLocked(); //true
          lock.leave(innerToken);
        });
      });
```

#### AsyncLockInstance#queueSize() -> number

Returns the number of callbacks currently pending on the lock.
Note than inside a callback that callback is no longer pending.

```js
 var lock = new AsyncLock();
 lock.enter(function (token) {
     lock.queueSize(); // 1
     token.leave();
 });
 lock.enter(function (token) {
    lock.queueSize(); // 0
    token.leave();
 });
```

#Wrapper

A simple to use interface around AsyncLocks without the
need to create your own lock instances.

```js
  var wrapper = require('node-async-locks');
```


### Basic Usage

```js

       wrapper.lock('myLock',function (leaveCallback) {
        //this code will be executed by only one caller at a time
        //...
        leaveCallback();
    });
}]
```

### Wrapper API

The wrapper provides a minimalistic API.
The underlying data structure is the AsyncLock, please refer to the helper functions
for details on how to customize some of the behavior.

#### wrapper#lock(lockName,callback,[timeout])

Tries to acquire the lock with the name _lockName_ and when successful executes the _callback_. If the lock
cannot be acquired waits (asynchronously) until the lock is freed.
The callback function signature is _callback(leave)_, it will receive a _leave_ function that must be called to free the lock.
If _timeout_ is provided will wait only the given amount of milliseconds and then cancel the call.
If _timeout_ is not provided will wait indefinitely.

```js
       wrapper.lock('foo',function (leave) {
         //Do something critical
        leave();
    });
```

#### wrapper#lockPromise(lockName,callback,...args) -> promise

Tries to acquire the lock with the name _lockName_ and when successful executes the _callback_. If the lock
cannot be acquired waits (asynchronously) until the lock is freed. Expects _callback_ to return a promise.
The lock is automatically frees when the promise returned by _callback_ is either resolved or rejected.
The rest of the arguments are passed directly to the callback function, the _this_ in the callback function is null.

Note that the wrapper uses ES6 Promises by default and falls back to BlueBird promises if ES6 Promises are not supported by your node version.
The Promise used by the wrapper is defined as ````wrapper.Promise```` and can be replaced by the user to any A+ promise library.

```js
       wrapper.lockPromise('foo',function () {
          wrapper.Promise.resolve('ok');
       }).then(function(message){
             //The lock is free here
       });
```

#### wrapper#isLocked(lockName) -> boolean

Returns true if the lock with the name _lockName_ is currently acquired and false otherwise.

```js
       wrapper.isLocked('foo'); //false
       wrapper.lock('foo',function (leave) {
           wrapper.isLocked('foo'); //true
           //Do something critical
           leave();
       });
```

#### wrapper#lockExists(lockName) -> boolean

Returns true if the lock with the name _lockName_ already exists in the service and false otherwise.

```js
       wrapper.lockExists('foo'); //false
       wrapper.lock('foo',function (leave) {
           //Do something critical
           leave();
       });
     wrapper.lockExists('foo'); //true
```

#### wrapper#queueSize(lockName) -> number

Returns the number of callbacks currently pending on the lock with the given name.
Note than inside a callback that callback is no longer pending.

```js

 wrapper.lock('foo',function (leave) {
     wrapper.queueSize('foo'); // 1
     leave();
 });

 wrapper.lock('foo',function (leave) {
    wrapper.queueSize('foo'); // 0
    leave();
 });
```

#### wrapper#getOptions(lockName) -> object

Returns a copy of the options of the lock with the given name, if the lock doesn't exist returns null

```js
       wrapper.lock('foo',function (leave) {
           //Do something critical
           leave();
       });
     var options = wrapper.getOptions('foo'); //returns the default options of an AsyncLock
```

#### wrapper#setOptions(lockName, options)

 Extends the options of a lock with the given name with the given options. If a lock with the given name doesn't exist,
 creates the lock and extends the default options with the given options. This function may be used to create a lock without entering it
 by calling ````wrapper.setOptions('foo');````

```js
    wrapper.setOptions('foo',{maxQueueSize:3}); //sets the maximum queue size of the lock foo to 3
                                                        //Other options remain unchanged
    wrapper.lock('foo',function (leave) {
           //Do something critical
           leave();
       });

```

#ResetEvent

## What is a ResetEvent?
The reset event is somewhat based on the C# [AutoResetEvent](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.autoresetevent(v=vs.110).aspx) and [ManualResetEvent](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.manualresetevent.aspx) classes.
It is similar to a promise only it can be used multiple times.
When a function begins an activity that must complete before other functions proceed, it calls _reset_ to put the ResetEvent in the non-signaled state.
Functions that call _wait_ on the reset event will not execute immediately, awaiting the signal. When the running function completes the activity, it calls _set_ to signal that the waiting functions can proceed.
All waiting functions are executed until the event becomes non-signaled.
Once it has been signaled, a reset event remains signaled until it is manually reset using the _reset_ function. That is, calls to _wait_ execute immediately.

### Basic Usage

```js
var ResetEvent = require('node-async-locks').ResetEvent;
```

```js

     var resetEvent = new ResetEvent();
      var x = 0;
      resetEvent.wait(function(){
          x+=1;
       });

      resetEvent.wait(function(){
          console.log(x); //2
       });
       x++;
       resetEvent.set();
}]
```

### Helper Functions

ResetEvent uses several helper functions (on the **prototype**) which can be overridden to provide custom functionality.

#### ResetEvent#createToken(callback) -> token

A function that creates the token which will be used in this reset event.
The token has the following fields:

* **id** - A unique id for each token, must be comparable using === operator.
* **isCanceled** - A boolean representing the cancellation state of the token.
* **callback** - The callback to be called when the token is ready to execute.
* **elapsed** - [optional] A function which returns the elapsed time between the creation of the token and now.
* **start** - [optional] The start time of when this token was created.
* **resetEvent** - [optional] A reference to the reset event that created this token.

#### ResetEvent#executeCallback(token)

A function which is used to execute the callback on the token.
The default implementation will execute the callback synchronously.

#### ResetEvent#reduceQueue(queue, options)

A function which is used to reduce the reset event queue size when a call to _wait_ is made.
If the options are changed pragmatically after an instance was created, it is up to the user to call this function to adjust the queue size.
Override this function to create different queuing logic.

### ResetEvent API

The main API of the ResetEvent object instance.
_ResetEventInstance_ represents an instance created by calling ````new ResetEvent()````

#### ResetEvent#constructor(isSignaled, options) -> ResetEventInstance

Creates a new ResetEventInstance using the given signaled state and options.
If no options are provided the default options are used.
The default options defined as ````ResetEvent.defaultOptions```` :
```js
{
        maxQueueSize: Infinity,
        overflowStrategy: 'this',
        autoResetCount: Infinity
}
```
Override any default option to make all future reset event instance created with the new defaults.

##### Supported Options
See AsyncLock [Supported Options](#supported-options) and:

* **autoResetCount** (number) [default Infinity] - The number of callbacks to call before the event is auto reset (becomes non-signaled).


#### ResetEventInstance#reset()

Marks the reset event as not signaled. All further calls to _wait_ will not execute immediately.

```js
 var resetEvent = new ResetEvent(true);
 resetEvent.wait(function(){
    //This is executed
 });
 resetEvent.reset();
 resetEvent.wait(function(){
    //This is not executed
 });
```

#### ResetEventInstance#set()

Marks the reset event as signaled and executes all pending callbacks. All further calls to _wait_ will execute immediately.
if _autoResetCount_ count option was passed, it will execute only the given number of callbacks (excluding canceled callbacks)
and then mark the event as non-signaled.

```js
 var resetEvent = new ResetEvent(false);
 var x;
 resetEvent.wait(function(){
    console.log(x); // 10
 });
 x = 10;
 resetEvent.set();
 resetEvent.wait(function(){
    console.log(x); // 10
 });
 x = 20;
 resetEvent.wait(function(){
    console.log(x); // 20
 });
```

#### ResetEventInstance#wait(callback,[timeout]) -> token

Waits until the reset event becomes signaled then executes the callback function.
If the reset event is already signaled when wait is called, the callback is executed immediately.
The callback function signature is _callback(token)_, it will receive the token returned by the _wait_ function.
If _timeout_ is provided will wait only the given amount of milliseconds and then cancel the call.
If _timeout_ is not provided will wait indefinitely.
Returns a token which can be used to track the elapsed time.

```js
 var resetEvent = new ResetEvent(false);
 var x;
 resetEvent.wait(function(){
    console.log(x); // This is never called
 },100);

 x = 10;

 setTimeout(function(){
    resetEvent.set();
  },1000);

 resetEvent.wait(function(){
    console.log(x); // 20
 });

 x = 20;

 resetEvent.wait(function(){
    console.log(x); // 20
 });
```

#### ResetEventInstance#isSignaled() -> boolean

Returns true if the reset event is currently signaled and false otherwise.

```js
 var resetEvent = new ResetEvent();
 resetEvent.isSignaled(); //false;
 resetEvent.set();
 resetEvent.isSignaled(); //true;
 resetEvent.reset();
 resetEvent.isSignaled(); //false;

```

#### ResetEventInstance#queueSize() -> number

Returns the number of callbacks currently pending on the reset event.
Note than inside a callback that callback is not considered pending.

```js
 var resetEvent = new ResetEvent(false);

 resetEvent.wait(function(){
    console.log(resetEvent.queueSize()); // 0
 });

 console.log(resetEvent.queueSize()); // 1
 resetEvent.set();
```
