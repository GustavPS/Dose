## Setup
DOSE is made up of two parts, the main server and then one or multiple movie servers. Each movie server connects to a main server. A movie request looks like this:
Client -> MainServer -> Client -> MovieServer -> Client

The client loads the webpage without any information from the MainServer. The client then sends a request to the MovieServer to get the movie information.

### Main Server
Import the file `dose` to a postgresql database called `dose`.

To start the main server run:

`$env:NODE_ENV="production"`

`npm run build`

`npm run start`

### Movie Server
First you have to edit `.env.local` in ContentServer and set the temp folder to a path. This path should have a quite large volume, since the temp transcoding files are located here.

To start the movie server run the following commands in the `MovieServer` folder.

`$env:NODE_ENV="production"`

`npm run build`

`npm run start`

Go to http://localhost:3001 and follow the setup process. After you've done the setup steps it's recommended that you restart the server. 

#### Add users
To add users to the server go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard/admins and add the users. Note that they have to be registered to the Main Server before this step.
