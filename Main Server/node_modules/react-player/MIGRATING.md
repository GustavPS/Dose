## Migrating to `v2.0`

Breaking changes are in ðŸ”¥ __bold and on fire__.

### Lazy players

ReactPlayer v2.0 uses [React lazy loading](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) to only load the players required based on the `url` prop passed in. Previous versions of ReactPlayer would include the code for all players, regardless of what type of player is used.

Because of this, ðŸ”¥ __single player imports are now redundant, and have been removed__. Instead of importing single players, you can safely import from `react-player` and only the relevant player will be loaded if you only use one type of `url`.

```jsx
// Before
import YouTubePlayer from 'react-player/lib/players/YouTube'

// After
import YouTubePlayer from 'react-player'
```

Due to the use of `lazy` and `Suspense`, ðŸ”¥ __React 16.6 or later is now required__.

### Preloading

The `preload` config option was originally added to solve a [very specific use case](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player/issues/7) a very long time ago. Modern browsers are trending towards disabling autoplay by default, which makes the preload behaviour quite useless. The implementation was also quite hacky, and added to the bundle size for a feature that seems to be very rarely used. For this reason, ðŸ”¥ __the `preload` option has been removed__.

### The `config` prop

ðŸ”¥ __Deprecated config props have been removed.__ Previously these props still worked, but with a console warning.

```jsx
// Before
<ReactPlayer 
  youtubeConfig={{ playerVars: { showinfo: 1 } }} 
/>

// After
<ReactPlayer 
  config={{ youtube: { playerVars: { showinfo: 1 } }}} 
/>
```

It is also worth noting that you no longer need to use separate config keys for different players. For example, if you are only ever using one type of `url` you can put player-specific options directly inside `config`.

```jsx
// Before
<ReactPlayer 
  youtubeConfig={{ playerVars: { showinfo: 1 } }} 
/>

// After
<ReactPlayer 
  config={{ playerVars: { showinfo: 1 } }} 
/>
```

### `onReady` is invoked with the player instance

Previously, instance methods would be called using [refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html). They still can, but in v2.0, `onReady` is called with the ReactPlayer instance, giving you the option of storing the instance and calling methods on it. This is especially useful when using `getInternalPlayer`.

```jsx
// Before
class Player extends Component {
  ref = player => {
    this.player = player            // Store a player that may not be ready for methods
    this.player.getInternalPlayer() // Returns null if player is not ready
  }
  handleReady = () => {
    this.player.getInternalPlayer() // Internal player now ready
  }
  render () {
    return (
      <ReactPlayer ref={this.ref} onReady={this.handleReady} />
    )
  }
}

// After
class Player extends Component {
  handleReady = player => {
    this.player = player            // Store a player that is ready for methods
    this.player.getInternalPlayer() // Internal player now ready
  }
  render () {
    return (
      <ReactPlayer onReady={this.handleReady} />
    )
  }
}
